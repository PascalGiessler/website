      Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected.

      My website contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents I have no influence. Therefore, I cannot assume any liability for these external contents.

      However, a permanent control of the contents of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of law. If I become aware of any infringements, I will remove such links immediately.
